  Greetings! My name is Horacio Parisotto, a passionate developer from Argentina. I have refined my coding expertise through rigorous training and hands-on projects, including completing programs at the University of Code and JS Mastery. My work primarily involves building robust applications that address real-world challenges, with a strong focus on technologies like JavaScript, React, and Next.js. Currently, I am expanding my portfolio with innovative projects such as a banking finance app, a healthcare app, and a virtual shopping mall concept.
